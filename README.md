Plugins
_______

This is a set of ImageJ plugins for color image segmentation. The set features four plugins:


* The original K-Means plugin from Jarek Sacha's IJ Plugin Toolkit (that you can also find [here](http://ij-plugins.sourceforge.net/plugins/clustering/))
* A refactored version of the original K-Means plugin providing color space selection (RGB, XYZ, L*a*b*, HSB), a simpler initialization criterion and a few more visualization modes
* A Fuzzy C-Means variant introducing another initialization criterion plus a new visualization mode
* A Spatial version of the Fuzzy C-Means algorithm that considers, for each pixel, a window containing the neighbor pixels in order to compute the membership function

Features
========

Color space conversion
----------------------

Color images can be converted into four different color spaces (considering RGB) leading to differently clustered images:

* XYZ a standardized color space, similar to RGB but with less correlated components
* L*a*b* a perceptional uniform color space that provides human predictable segmentation results
* HSB similar to L*a*b* for its purpose of giving a more human readable color representation, but differs in the representation of the luminance component and consequently of the chroma

Visualization modes
-------------------

* Cluster Centroid Color each cluster has been assigned its centroid color (in case of color conversion the color space is converted back to RGB)
* Gray Scale each pixel is labelled with the number of the cluster it belongs to, and the image range is stretched in 0-255
* Random RGB a random RGB color is generated for each cluster, it may be very useful when many clusters share a similar centroid color value
* Binary Stack a stack of binary images is outputted, each of those representing a cluster: a black pixel belongs to the current slice cluster, a white not. It may be useful to extract back the original region with an OR operation
* Fuzzy Stack a stack of gray scaled images is used to show the membership values of each pixel to each cluster, the darker the pixel in a slice, the more the corresponding pixel in the original images belongs (in a fuzzy sense) to the currently selected cluster

Installation
============

Just put the jar file (that you can find in the /Releases/ directory of the project) under the /plugins directory of ImageJ and relaunch it. The plugins will appear in the Plugins>Segmentation menu. 
A micro guide explaining the user interface can be found in the /doc/ directory.
